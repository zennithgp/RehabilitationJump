	//HOLY CRAP, THAT WAS SO MUCH DEBUGGING FOR ONE STUPID LINE OF CODE.
	//Apparently, the StreamReader was appending when I told it not to and deleting the first line of the story every time it saved.
	//Three hours of debugging for one line of code. rrrrrRGH.

	/*So, here's what needs be done.
	 *When the game starts, it reads the text file and puts it into a list.
	 *You then move to a random line in the list between 2 and 39.
	 *The UI shows you the previous and following lines.
	 *When you click the button, it takes the text from the input file, updates that line from the list, and moves you to another line.
	 *When you click the save button, it saves the list back to the text file.
	 *
	 *
	 *Holy crap, we're done!
